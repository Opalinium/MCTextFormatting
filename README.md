# MCTextFormatting
Text formatting for Minecraft chat which mirrors markdown, but isn't exactly the same.

\*italics\*<br/>
\*\*bolds\*\*<br/>
\_\_underline\_\_<br/>
\~\~strikethrough~\~<br/>
##garbled##<br/>

&'s are also replaced with the ยง special formatting character

Simply put a \\ in front of a character to use it as normal
